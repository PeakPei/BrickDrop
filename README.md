# Brick Drop for iOS #
Brick Drop is a game created in Objective-C / SpriteKit framework

I'm now open sourcing my app, it is no longer on the app store and I don't have a use for it being private anymore and figured it will serve as a good thing to have on my digital portfolio.

# As for what BrickDrop is: #
Brick Drop was my first attempt at an iOS based game, at the time it was a completely foreign concept to me, I would of never touched the iOS platform in terms of development prior to this. I was familiar with iOS and Jailbreaking and knew it down to its core functionality but this was my way of seeing what it is like to create an App. I bought a Apple Developer license (which was mandatory at the time to test on device) and once I had completed the app I launched it free on the App Store, not for any gain but just as a way to say I had done it and had made an app.

The main point of the game is to keep going down the platforms as the platforms keep getting faster and faster until you lose.
